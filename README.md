## Image Aesthetics impact on Social Media Engagement
The repository explores various methodologies and technologies that contribute to the exploration if image aesthetics affect the engagement of the photo on social media.  
### Description
One of the most important and possible factors affecting user engagement on social networking sites is the aesthetic quality of photographs. The combination of **Deep Learning, Neural Networks** enables the development of an automated system for evaluating the effects and enagement predictability of images. This system provides dependable insights for optimizing content.
### Models used for prediction
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVC - Support Vector Classification
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. XGBoost - Extreme Gradient Boosting
6. MLP - Multi-Layer Perceptron

Utilizing the machine learning and deep learning models mentioned above, we successfully improved the accuracy of all models in predicting the engagement dynamics for each image in the dataset. Additionally, the implementation of these models involved relevant Python libraries, including **Torch, Seaborn, and TensorFlow**.### Dataset
Extracted a dataset of 1600 food images. These images were extracted from instagram itself with a configuration the HAR file. It contains various insightful columns such as :-

1. Shortcode - Every image has its own shortcode.
2. Likes_count
3. Comments_count
4. caption
